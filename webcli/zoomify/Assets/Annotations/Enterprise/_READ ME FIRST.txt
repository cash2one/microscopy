Annotation Graphics Files

This product's implementation of support for annotations includes many predefined graphics. These include simple examples such as "labelFromJPEG.jpg" that are designed to demonstrate how hotspot graphics work, as well as more useful examples such as "arrowDown.png" that can be employed in production web sites.

Please note that the latter examples can be easily modified using the editable source files included in the file "annotationLabelSourceFiles.zip".  It is also a simple matter to create new annotation graphics by starting from the included source files - or starting from your own image files.

Users of Zoomify's Flash-based Enterprise Annotation Viewer will find many of the included graphics familiar.  Please note, however, that the graphics in this HTML5-based product are standalone, external graphics files.  These separate files in the Assets/Annotations folder must be uploaded to your webserver to be available for use by the Annotations feature of the HTML5-based Zoomify Image Viewer. 

The reason for this difference is as follows: Zoomify's Flash-based Zoomify Annotation Viewer is a Flash movie - a '.swf' file that includes instructions written in the ActionScript scripting lanugage - plus - an internal, built-in set of vector graphics.  However, Zoomify's HTML5-based Zoomify Image Viewer with annotation features is simply a text file - a '.js' file that includes instructions written in the JavaScript scripting language and stored as text - without any internal graphics or other contents.  The annotation graphics must therefore be stored externally, as separate files.

Features of the Flash-based Annotation Viewer not yet supported in the HTML5-based Viewer:

 - Polygonal hotspots: if an annotations XML file includes polygonal hotspot coordinates, the Viewer will place a graphic indicating the feature is not supported.  The image file for this graphic is named "noSubstitutePlaceholder.png". It can easily be edited or replaced.  Alternatively, the polygon reference in the annotations XML file can be removed until polygonal hotspot support is added to the Zoomify Image Viewer in the future.

 - HTML code within annotations XML for captions and tooltips: color, font, and other references in the annotations XML will be ignored.
 
 - Editing: annotations XML can be created manually or via the Flash-based Viewer in Edit Mode.  The HTML5-based Viewer is for viewing only at this time.
